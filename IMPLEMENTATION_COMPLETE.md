### ✅ Demo & Documentation

#### 1. **Demo Scripts**
- ✅ Created: `demo_causal_flow.py` - Complete API testing and demonstration
- ✅ Created: `frontend_demo_guide.py` - Frontend testing scenarios
- ✅ Created: `start_system.py` - One-click system startup
- ✅ Features: Comprehensive test scenarios, API validation, user guidance

#### 2. **Documentation**
- ✅ Created: `CAUSAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete technical documentation
- ✅ Content: Architecture overview, API specifications, usage examples
- ✅ Coverage: Setup instructions, performance metrics, future roadmap

## 🚀 How to Use the System

### Quick Start
```bash
# One-command startup
python start_system.py

# Manual startup
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend && python main_enhanced.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend && npm start

# Terminal 3 - Demo
python demo_causal_flow.py
```

### Key Features to Test

#### 1. **Causal Analysis in Chat**
- Ask: "Show me detected anomalies"
- Ask: "Why was invoice INV-2025-004 flagged?"
- Look for: 🧠 Causal Analysis section with cause-and-effect chains

#### 2. **Risk-Based Holds Dashboard**
- Navigate to: Anomaly Dashboard → Risk-Based Holds tab
- See: Summary statistics, detailed hold breakdown
- Test: Filtering by type/status, refresh functionality

#### 3. **API Integration**
```bash
# Test causal analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/query \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message": "Show me anomalies and their causes"}'

# Test risk-based holds
curl http://localhost:8000/api/risk-holds
```
